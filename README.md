# irrigation-priority-system

Assuming a hypothetical where agricultural regions are seeking maximum efficiency in water usage, this program implements a flexible two-tier priority-queue system for a smart irrigation prototype. It uses user-defined priority functions to rank crops within regions, and regions within the system, allowing for real-time adaptation to changing water-allocation rules.
